Project materials to complete the DevOps code challenge for Seek:


it was designed to be bootstrapped with ansible, using the following command:

ansible-playbook -i 'localhost,', aws-bootstrap.yml


Unfortunately orchestrating Lambda is not something I've done before and despiste 
my research efforts the past day the playbook is still buggy - I will need to use lambda_facts 
and build out the Ansible playbook but at this point I'm too constrained for time.

The project will:

Create a AWS Lambda to update a security group with HTTP/HTTPS ingress allowed

Create a AWS CloudWatch cron event to trigger the Lamdba above once daily

Create a AWS API Gateway that will trigger the Lambda above upon reciept of POST request
